I chose to implement the project with the MVC Paradigm.
It also has three consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty.

I chose to implement those two, because I am used to the MVC paradigm, as I use it daily.
and I chose to imeplement the distinct levels optinal task, because it seemed to require little effort compared to the other ones.

I contemplated implementing the two-player local multiplayer, but I couldn't figure out what it would look like on mobile.


The controls are left arrow, right arrow, and up arrow on keyboard
